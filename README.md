# PointNet_on_3D-Point_Cloud
 Implementation of PointNet NN for Object recognition on 3D Point Cloud using ModelNet10 Dataset. Achieved 83% Accuracy.

# How to Run:
	1.The python code is available as .ipynb files.
	2.There are 2 files
		a. main.ipynb 	- Contains the main code for preprocessing and training program
		b. plots.ipynb	- Contains various visualisations used for exploring given dataset(used prior to main.ipynb)

	3.Hence open the codes in jupyter notebook, install dependancies and libraries provided in the notebook if necessary.
		installations codes are available as '!pip install ' lines.
	4.Copy path of extracted ModelNet10 directory in path = "*/ModelNet10" (assuming ModelNet10.zip is extracted)
	5.Run the code cell by cell till end.
